# Vegetation Analysis Tool

## Overview
This project provides a vegetation analysis tool designed to process aerial or drone-captured images to assess plant health and land coverage. The tool applies image processing techniques to identify different vegetation health levels, calculate coverage, and detect anomalies in agricultural or natural environments.

## Features
- **Vegetation Health Classification**: Categorizes areas into different health levels (e.g., healthy, medium health, stressed, and unplantable zones).
- **Coverage Analysis**: Computes total analyzed area, pixel count, and coverage percentage.
- **Health Metrics**: Includes indices such as health index, uniformity, and vegetation density.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies areas that significantly deviate from normal vegetation conditions.

## Example Output
The following image showcases the tool in action, with a processed aerial view and corresponding vegetation health report:

## Applications
- Precision agriculture for crop health monitoring
- Land coverage studies and ecological assessments
- Environmental monitoring for conservation efforts

## Getting Started
To use the tool, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed and provide an input image for analysis. The tool will generate a detailed report visualizing vegetation health and anomalies.
